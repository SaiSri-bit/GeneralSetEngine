# GeneralSetEngine
A generalized set engine that handles and allows operations on set based mathematical objects like groups, topological spaces, measurable spaces, and graphs.


Generally "elements" is used as a variable in place of the phrase of set to prevent any possible complication between the class set and a variable of the same name.
